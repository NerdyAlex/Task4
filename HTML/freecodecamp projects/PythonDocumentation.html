                <p>Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum
                and first released in 1991, it emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of
                code. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
                
                <p>Its extensive standard library and supportive community make it ideal for various applications, from web development to
                data science. Python's syntax is straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners while still powerful
                enough for experienced developers.</p>
                
                <p>It is widely used in industries like finance, healthcare, and technology. Python's versatility and ease of use have made
                it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

            <section id="Hello_World!!" class="main-section">
                <header>Hello World!!</header>
                <p>To get started with writing Python, open your favorite text editor and write your first "Hello world" Python code:</p>
                <pre><p><code>    print("Hello World!!")</code></p></pre>
                <p>Yes It's that simple even your GrandMa can do it in her sleep</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
                to certain  rules</p>            
                <p>1. Can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores: This means they can include letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9),
                and underscores (_), but no special characters or spaces</p>
                <p>2. Case-sensitive: Variable names are case-sensitive, so myVariable and myvariable are considered different variables.</p>
                <p>To declare a Variable we:</p>
                <pre><p><code>    variable = "My name is Lexy"</code></p></pre>
                <p>Simple!!</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
                <header>Data Types</header>
                <p>There are Some data types to note:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Interger.</b> <code>9, 2, 0</code></li>
                    <li><b>String.</b> <code>"Hello", "SpongBob"</code></li>
                    <li><b>Boolean.</b> <code>True and False</code>.</li>
                    <li><b>Tuple.</b> <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>.</li>
                    <li><b>List.</b> <code>[1, 2, 3]</code></li>
                    <li><b>Dictionary.</b> <code>{'key': 'value'}</code></li>
                    <p>Although these data types might seem limited, they enable you to perform a wide range of useful functions in your
                    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.</p>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="Conditional_Statements" class="main-section">
                <header>Conditional Statements</header>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
                statement if the condition is false</p>
                <p>Let's create a simple python project:</p>
                    <pre><code><p>    temp = int(input("What is your temperature"))
    if temp >= 37:
        print("You have a fever")
    else:
        print("You don't have a fever")</p></code></pre>
        <p>Let's take it step by step</p>
                <ul>           
                    <li><code>temp</code> accepts a integer <code>int</code> which is the user temperature.</li>
                    <li><code>if</code> the user input is greater than or equal to 37, we <code>print</code> <code>You have a fever</code> </li>

                    <li><code>else</code> it well just<code>print</code>s <code>You don't have a fever</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Conditional statement are fun to use. There are some more like <code>while</code>, <code>elif</code> etc.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
                <header>Functions</header>
                <p>Finally, last but not the least sadly Functions <code>def</code></p>
                <p>Let's learn how to declare a function:</p>
                <pre><code><p>    def greet_me():
        name= input("enter you name: ")
        print("Hello " + name)
        
    greet_me()</p></code></pre>

                <p>Again let me explain:</p>
                <li>I defined a <code>def</code> function called <code>greet_me()</code></li>
                <li>I asked the user for <code>input</code> as their <code>name</code></li>
                <li>I had to print out the Greeting by put it in <code>print</code></li>
                <li>Lastly I had to call our <code>greet_me()</code> <code>def</code> function</li>
                <p>When you run this code:</p>
                <p>A greeting message with the user's name is printed to the screen.</p>

                <p>I know this Documentation doesn't really cover the whole Python Language. I really didn't think much of you guys when I was building this project. This is a freecodecamp project.I'm so sorry not,But I would be more than happy to link you up to a 10 hour-long Python course on Youtube. Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAFL1597eM">Click here</a>. You are Welcome. Byeee</p>
